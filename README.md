# 🌡️ Temperature Converter in C

A simple C program that converts temperatures between **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit** based on the user's input. It uses basic arithmetic operations and function calls to perform the conversion.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Takes a temperature value from the user
- Offers two conversion options:
  - **Fahrenheit to Celsius**
  - **Celsius to Fahrenheit**
- Calls separate functions for each conversion
- Uses conditionals (`if-else`) for logic control

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- `scanf()` and `printf()` usage
- Arithmetic expressions in C
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Function definitions and calls
- Use of `signed int` and global variables

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open the file in any C IDE or compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks, DevC++, Turbo C++)
2. Compile and run the program
3. Enter a temperature value
4. Choose the desired conversion type
5. View the result

## 📌 Example Output

Enter temperature value: 100
Choose option
1: Farenhite to celcius 2:Celcius to farenhite
Enter your choice: 1
Your choice is 1
